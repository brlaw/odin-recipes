    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tomato soup is a warm, comforting dish made from pureed tomatoes, broth, and a variety of seasonings. It’s perfect for a chilly day and pairs wonderfully with grilled cheese sandwiches or crusty bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cans diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream (optional, for creamier soup)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the diced tomatoes (with their juices) and vegetable broth. Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. You can adjust the heat to low after it starts simmering.</li>
        <li>Once the soup is ready, use an immersion blender to puree it until smooth. Alternatively, you can transfer the soup in batches to a blender and puree it (be careful as the soup is hot).</li>
        <li>If the soup is too thick, you can add a bit more broth or water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Stir in the heavy cream if you want a creamier texture. Season with salt, pepper, and sugar to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil or parsley, if desired. Enjoy with a side of bread or grilled cheese!</li>
    </ol>
